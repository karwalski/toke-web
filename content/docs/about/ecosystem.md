title: The *oke Ecosystem
slug: ecosystem
section: about
order: 5
---

A layered stack of tools, frameworks, and runtimes -- each named with the `*oke` convention. Four characters, always pronounceable, always part of the family.

## toke — language

The core programming language. Compiles to native code via LLVM. 59-character alphabet, 14 keywords, backtrack-free grammar with bounded lookahead. Token efficiency is measured, not assumed: under cl100k_base toke costs 1.34x the tokens of equivalent Python on the 60 Gate-1 tasks (N = 60) and no shipped toke tokenizer yet beats cl100k_base on v0.4 text (N = 2,000) -- see `docs/metrics-baseline.md`. Gate 2 PASS: 100% compilation Pass@1 on a fine-tuned 7B model (curated set, v0.3 model).

## ooke — web framework

Static site generator and web framework built in toke. File-system routing, flat-file content store, template engine with Markdown, build and serve modes. Zero dependencies. Ships as a single binary. Serves [tokelang.dev](https://tokelang.dev) in production.

## loke — intelligence layer

A locally-run intelligence layer that sits between users, their data, and external LLMs. Multi-layer PII detection, token optimisation, intelligent routing, governance controls, memory palace, MCP framework. All processing on-device.

## moke — demo application

Data analysis demo exercising loke's privacy pipeline, governance controls, and LLM integration end-to-end. 26-detector analysis engine, 9 Australian-themed datasets, client-side ML. Integrated into the loke project.

## aoke — human experience (reserved)

The topmost layer. Sound, light, perception -- the interface between computation and the senses. UX, design systems, accessibility, and sensory analytics.

## zoke — hardware layer (reserved)

The bottommost layer. Silicon, electrons, circuits -- the physical substrate of computation. Drivers, ISA, FPGA, and everything below the OS.

## The *oke naming convention

Every tool in the toke ecosystem uses a single consonant prefix followed by `oke`. Four characters, always pronounceable. The alphabetical ordering maps roughly to abstraction depth -- `zoke` at the hardware layer, `aoke` at the human experience layer -- giving the stack a built-in mnemonic.

| Layer | Name | Status | Description |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| Human experience | aoke | Reserved | UX, design systems, accessibility |
| Intelligence | loke | **Production** | Privacy, token optimisation, routing |
| Web | ooke | **Production** | Static site gen, web framework (serves tokelang.dev) |
| Language | toke | **Production** | Compiler, spec, stdlib (38 modules) |
| Data/demo | moke | **Active** | Analysis demo (in loke) |
| Hardware | zoke | Reserved | Drivers, ISA, FPGA |
