## The Problem

LLMs generate code token by token. Every token costs compute time and API dollars. Code generation is the single largest use case for large language models, and the languages those models generate -- Python, TypeScript, Go -- were designed for human authors, not machines.

These languages carry structural overhead that LLMs pay for on every generation pass:

- **Verbose keywords.** `function`, `return`, `import`, `class`, `def` -- multi-token keywords that convey single concepts.
- **Optional syntax.** Semicolons that are sometimes required and sometimes not. Parentheses that are sometimes needed and sometimes implicit. Multiple valid ways to write the same construct.
- **Whitespace significance.** Indentation as syntax (Python) forces the model to track invisible state across every line.
- **Ambiguous grammar.** Backtracking parsers, context-sensitive disambiguation, and overloaded operators all increase the space of invalid programs the model can generate.
- **Human-readable errors.** Prose error messages like `SyntaxError: unexpected indent` require the model to parse English to attempt a repair.

The result: LLMs spend 40--75% more tokens than necessary on syntactic overhead, documentation boilerplate, and whitespace conventions. They fail to compile on the first pass more often than they should, and waste additional tokens parsing unstructured error messages during repair loops.

## The Thesis

The central claim behind toke:

> A sufficiently constrained, unambiguous, token-efficient language will reduce end-to-end LLM code generation cost -- measured as (tokens x iterations x error rate) -- by a material margin sufficient to justify building and training a purpose-native model.

This is treated as an empirical hypothesis, not an article of faith. The project has explicit go/no-go gates. Gate 1 required greater than 10% token reduction and a Pass@1 rate of at least 60%. Both criteria were met — the project proceeds to Phase 2.

## How It Works

toke achieves token efficiency through deliberate constraint at every level of the language design:

**59-character minimal ASCII subset, lowercase-only.** The source language uses exactly 59 ASCII characters -- 26 lowercase letters, 10 digits, and 23 symbols (including `$` for type sigils, `@` for arrays, and the bitwise operators `% & ^ ~`). The design property is that the alphabet is small and **closed**, not the number itself; the count is derived from `src/lexer.c` and recorded once in `docs/metrics-baseline.md` § Project facts. No uppercase letters, no decorators, no underscores. toke source is comment-free by design; documentation lives in companion files (`.tkc`), not inline comments. The lexer silently discards `(* ... *)` sequences for backward compatibility, but this is not a language feature. No character outside this set appears in a structural position. Every character earns its place.

The double-quote `"` appears in source as the string literal delimiter but is not a structural symbol -- it is consumed during lexing and never produces a token, similar to how whitespace separates tokens but has no other structural role.

**14 keywords.** Where Python has 35 keywords and JavaScript has 64 reserved words, toke has 14: `m` (module), `f` (function), `t` (type), `i` (import), `if`, `el`, `lp` (loop), `br` (break), `let`, `mut`, `as`, `rt` (return), `mt` (match), `sc` (scope). Single-character keywords for declarations. Two-character keywords for control flow, match and scope. The v0.3 "13 keywords" wording is retired: `mut` and `sc` are keywords too (`docs/spec/toke-spec-v0.4.md` §A).

**Backtrack-free grammar.** The parser never rescans consumed input — no backtracking, no ambiguity. It is not strictly LL(1): a small, enumerated set of productions need bounded lookahead of up to 3 tokens (Appendix A of `grammar.ebnf`). Every syntactic position has exactly one valid interpretation. This means the model's generation space contains fewer invalid programs.

**Explicit everything.** No implicit returns. No optional semicolons. No structural whitespace -- indentation, line breaks, and spacing between tokens are all equivalent. No synonym constructs. One way to write each thing. The model never has to choose between equivalent forms.

**Structured diagnostics.** The compiler emits JSON diagnostics with stable error codes, machine-parseable source locations, and mechanically derivable fix suggestions. Repair loops consume errors without parsing English prose.

**Native compilation.** toke compiles to native machine code via LLVM. No runtime interpreter, no virtual machine, no garbage collector. The output is a self-contained binary.

## Token Efficiency in Practice

Token counts for a complete runnable fibonacci(10) program, measured with cl100k_base (GPT-4 tokenizer):

| Language | Minimal | With documentation |
|---|---|---|
| toke | 59 | 59 (comment-free by design -- no documentation overhead in source) |
| Python | 41 | 82 (one-line docstrings) |
| C | 59 | 75 (Doxygen comments) |
| Java | 62 | 102 (Javadoc comments) |

On a general-purpose tokenizer, toke matches C and beats Java for bare code. toke's token cost advantage comes from predictable syntax, single-token operators, and consistent lowercase -- not from an artificially small character count. The structural advantage emerges as documentation standards are applied: Python doubles from 41 to 82 tokens with docstrings, while toke stays at 59 -- there are no comments to add. toke source is comment-free by design; documentation lives in companion files (`.tkc`), so the token cost of generated source is fixed regardless of coding standards.

A purpose-built BPE tokenizer can merge patterns like `:i64):i64{`, `m=`, `f=main():i64{` and `i=j:std.json` into single tokens; that is the design argument for one. It is **not yet a measured win**. Under one shared tokenizer (cl100k_base) toke costs **1.34x [1.22, 1.48]** the tokens of equivalent Python on the 60 Gate-1 tasks (N = 60, 2026-09-19) -- more, not fewer. The v0.3-era "52% fewer tokens" figure was a *tokenizer-vs-tokenizer* measurement on identical toke text (Toke-16K v0.3 vs cl100k_base, N = 42) and is superseded: on canonical v0.4 text the shipped 8K tokenizer needs **15.4% more** tokens than cl100k_base (N = 2,000). See `docs/metrics-baseline.md`. The per-example "14 toke BPE tokens vs 27 for Python on cl100k" comparison that used to sit here is withdrawn: it counted the toke side with a toke-trained tokenizer and the Python side with cl100k, which measures the tokenizer's training bias rather than the languages (`docs/about/samples-v04.md` reports every lane side by side).

At Gate 1, toke demonstrated 12.5% token reduction versus cl100k_base and **58.8%** functional Pass@1 on 1,000 held-out tasks (588/1,000).

*Pass@1 corrected 2026-09-19 (story 128.19): 58.8%, not 63.7%.* This sentence read "63.7% first-pass compilation accuracy (Pass@1) ... both exceeding the required thresholds" until that date, and was wrong twice over. 1,000 solutions were generated, 923 compiled, 588 passed every hidden test. The published 63.7% was 588/**923** -- the 77 solutions that failed to compile were dropped from the denominator, which measures Pass@1 *given that the solution compiled*. A solution that fails to compile is a failed attempt, not an absent one, so the denominator is the 1,000 generated: 588/1,000 = **58.8%**. It is also the *functional* Pass@1, not a compilation rate; the compile rate was 92.3% (923/1,000). **58.8% is below the >= 60% minimum Gate 1 declared for itself, so the Gate 1 verdict is re-opened and has not been re-decided here.** See `docs/decisions/gate1-decision.md`.

## Who Benefits

**AI companies.** Every token saved in code generation is a direct cost reduction -- which is why the honest position matters: under the tokenizers production models actually use, toke does **not** yet save tokens against Python (cl100k_base, 60 Gate-1 tasks: toke/Python 1.34x [1.22, 1.48], N = 60). The savings case rests on a v0.4-native tokenizer that has not been trained yet (116.9), on fewer generate-compile-repair round trips, and on a fixed, comment-free source cost.

**Developers building AI-powered coding tools.** Tools that generate, test, and deploy code autonomously need a language that minimises round trips through the generate-compile-repair loop. toke's structured diagnostics and deterministic grammar reduce iterations.

**Researchers studying code generation efficiency.** toke provides a controlled experimental surface -- a language co-designed with its tokenizer and training corpus -- for studying the relationship between language design and model performance.

## The Vision

toke is not replacing Python. It is not a general-purpose language for human software teams.

toke is a **compilation target for AI**. The workflow:

1. A user describes what they want in natural language.
2. An LLM generates toke source -- fewer tokens, faster, cheaper.
3. The toke compiler validates and compiles to a native binary.
4. If compilation fails, structured diagnostics feed back into the model for mechanical repair.
5. The user gets a working binary.

The human never reads the toke source. The LLM never wastes tokens on verbose syntax. The compiler never emits an error message the model cannot parse. Every component in the chain is designed for the others.
