# Request for Research Feedback

**Project:** toke — A Programming Language Designed to Reduce Token Cost of AI-Generated Code
**Date:** 2026-05-23 (updated with research review responses)
**Author:** Matthew Watt (karwalski)
**Status:** Post-Gate 2, planning 12-week functional correctness sprint. v0.3 syntax locked.
**Reasoning channel:** Out-of-band reasoning mandated via `.tkc` companion files — see [reasoning-channel.md](reasoning-channel.md)

---

## Executive Summary

toke is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed from first principles so that large language models can write better code. After 18 months of development, we have achieved:

- **Gate 1 (2026-04-03):** **58.8%** functional Pass@1 with legacy syntax (588 of 1,000 solutions generated); 92.3% compiled. *Published as "63.7% Pass@1 compilation rate" until 2026-09-19 (story 128.19) — wrong twice over: 63.7% was 588/**923**, computed after the 77 non-compiling solutions had been dropped from the denominator, and it is the functional rate, not the compilation rate. 58.8% is below Gate 1's own >= 60% minimum, so that verdict is re-opened and has not been re-decided.*
- **Gate 2 (2026-05-22):** 100% Pass@1 compilation rate with default syntax (7B model)
- **Functional correctness:** 55.6% (corrected from ~8% after stdlib fix — see gate2-decision.md)

We are seeking feedback from researchers in code generation, curriculum learning, program synthesis, and AI safety on our next training phase design.

## The toke Language

### Design Thesis

LLMs waste tokens on syntactic overhead that provides no semantic value. Comments, docstrings, whitespace conventions, camelCase/snake_case naming, and verbose keywords all consume tokens without helping the model reason about computation. toke eliminates this overhead by design.

### Key Properties

| Property | Value | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Character set | 59 (a-z, 0-9, 23 symbols) | Eliminates tokenizer ambiguity from uppercase, underscore, most special chars |
| Keywords | 14 (m, i, t, f, let, if, el, lp, br, rt, as, mt, sc, mut) | Minimal control flow vocabulary |
| Grammar | Backtrack-free, deterministic | The parser never rescans consumed input; a small, enumerated set of productions need bounded lookahead of up to 3 tokens (spec §E) |
| Comments | None | Documentation lives in companion files (.tkc), never in source |
| Naming | Lowercase concatenated only | No case conventions, no underscores |
| Type system | Static, structural, with sum types | Errors are values, not exceptions |
| Separator | Semicolons exclusively | No commas anywhere — eliminates a common LLM error |
| Compilation | LLVM backend → native binaries | Real programs, not interpreted |

### Language Specification

The full normative specification is available at:
- **Spec:** [toke-spec-v0.3.md](toke-spec-v0.3.md) (142KB, 31 sections)
- **Grammar:** [grammar.ebnf](grammar.ebnf) (EBNF, 53 productions; Appendix A gives the FIRST-sets and the enumerated bounded-lookahead exceptions)
- **Gate 1 decision:** [gate1-decision.md](../docs/gate1-decision.md)
- **Gate 2 decision:** [gate2-decision.md](gate2-decision.md)

## Training Results

### Gate 1 (Legacy 86-character syntax)

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Base model | Qwen 2.5 Coder 7B-Instruct |
| Method | QLoRA (rank 64, alpha 128) |
| Corpus | 73,000 records (synthetic, multi-format) |
| Compilation Pass@1 | 92.3% (923/1,000 generated) |
| Functional Pass@1 | **58.8%** (588/1,000 generated) — published as "63.7% (588/923 compilable tasks)" until 2026-09-19, story 128.19 |
| Token reduction | 12.5% vs cl100k_base (8K vocab BPE) |

### Gate 2 (Default syntax)

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Base model | Qwen 2.5 Coder 7B-Instruct |
| Method | QLoRA (rank 64, alpha 128, 3 epochs) |
| Corpus | 25,953 records (canonical prompt, includes 6,069 from production codebase) |
| Compilation Pass@1 | **100%** (700/700 tasks) |
| Functional Pass@1 | 55.6% (272/489) — corrected 2026-05-25 from ~8% after io.readln() fix |
| BPE tokenizer | 8,192 tokens, trained on v0.3 corpus |
| Training time | 37 hours on NVIDIA A10G 24GB |

### Key Observation

The model achieved **perfect syntax** with a relatively small corpus (25K) and modest hardware. This validates the language design thesis: a constrained, unambiguous grammar is dramatically easier for LLMs to learn than general-purpose languages.

However, **functional correctness** (producing correct algorithms) requires capabilities beyond syntax mastery.

## Proposed Next Phase: Curriculum Learning

We propose a 6-phase progressive training curriculum:

| Phase | Objective | Corpus Size | Success Metric |
|-------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| 1. Token completion | Complete partial lines | 10K | >95% valid |
| 2. Single statement | Write one statement given context | 20K | >90% valid, >60% semantic |
| 3. Single function | Complete function from signature + description | 30K | >85% compile, >50% functional |
| 4. Multi-function | Write programs with multiple cooperating functions | 15K | >80% compile, >40% functional |
| 5. Multi-module | Write systems spanning multiple files with imports | 5K | >70% compile, >30% functional |
| 6. Full application | Design complete applications from requirements | 1K | Compiles as unit |

Each phase uses the previous phase's checkpoint as starting point. Evaluation gates progression.

## Questions for Researchers

### Curriculum Design

1. **Phase boundaries:** Are our 6 phases the right granularity? Should statement→function have intermediate steps (e.g., "write a loop body", "write a conditional")?

2. **Curriculum scheduling:** Should we use strict gating (must pass threshold before advancing) or mixed sampling (gradually increase difficulty while still training on earlier phases)?

3. **Negative examples:** Should we include "broken → fixed" pairs at each phase? The compiler provides structured diagnostics — is this a useful training signal?

### Self-Improvement Loop

4. **Bootstrapping:** We can generate 50K candidates at 100% compile rate and 55.6% functional rate. Is rejection sampling (keep only correct) the best use of this, or should we also train on the incorrect-but-compilable examples with appropriate labels?

5. **Diversity:** When generating training data via self-play, how do we avoid mode collapse (model generating the same solution patterns repeatedly)?

6. **Verification oracle:** Our test I/O is limited to 10–31 cases per task. Is this sufficient to trust functional correctness, or do we need property-based testing / formal verification for higher confidence?

### Model Architecture

7. **Model size:** Given perfect syntax at 7B, should we invest in:
   - (a) More data for the same 7B model
   - (b) A larger base model (32B/70B) for better reasoning
   - (c) A mixture: 70B generates data for 7B distillation

8. **Tokenizer integration:** We have a purpose-built 8K BPE tokenizer for toke. Should we:
   - (a) Replace the base model's tokenizer entirely
   - (b) Add toke tokens to the existing vocab (vocabulary extension)
   - (c) Keep the base tokenizer and let the model learn the mapping

9. **Multi-language transfer:** The model was pre-trained on Python/JS/Go/Rust. Is there measurable transfer from these languages to toke algorithmic reasoning, or does the syntax difference break transfer?

### Data Collection

10. **MCP telemetry:** We plan to collect compile-verified code from developer usage via MCP (IDE integration). What privacy/bias concerns should we address? How do we handle the distribution shift between "code developers actually write" vs "benchmark tasks"?

11. **Community contributions:** We're considering open-sourcing the corpus and accepting community-contributed solutions. What quality control mechanisms would you recommend?

### Evaluation

12. **Beyond Pass@1:** What metrics beyond compilation and functional correctness should we track? Suggestions: token efficiency of generated code, code diversity, robustness to prompt variation, compositional generalisation.

13. **Difficulty calibration:** Our benchmark tasks range from "return absolute value" to "implement quicksort". How should we weight difficulty in our metrics? Is a single Pass@1 number meaningful, or should we report per-difficulty-band?
